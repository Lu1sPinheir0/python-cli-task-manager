# Python CLI Task Manager with Pomodoro

A command-line task management tool with a built-in Pomodoro timer. This project serves as a practical demonstration of several key programming concepts, including:

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
* Modular and clean code architecture.
* File handling with JSON for data persistence.
* Effective use of Enums for readable and robust code.

## Features

This command-line interface (CLI) application provides the following features:

* **Task Creation:** Add new tasks with a name, description, priority (`HIGH`, `MID`, `LOW`), and estimated time to completion.
* **Task Viewing:** Display all tasks organized by their priority level.
* **Task Completion:** Mark tasks as completed, updating their status.
* **Pomodoro Timer:** Start a Pomodoro timer cycle for a specific task, with customizable work and break intervals.
* **Data Persistence:** Save and load the task list to and from a JSON file (`Task_lists.json`), ensuring your data is not lost between sessions.
